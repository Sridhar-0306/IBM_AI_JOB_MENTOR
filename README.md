## Project Overview

AI Job Mentor for Informal Workers is an AI-powered chatbot solution designed to support millions of informal sector workers including daily wage laborers, artisans, gig workers, and the self-employed. The platform leverages IBM Watson technologies and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to deliver personalized job recommendations, identify skill gaps, provide upskilling resources, and inform users about government schemes and opportunities. The chatbot offers 24/7 accessible, vernacular-language support via both web and WhatsApp, helping bridge the opportunity gap in semi-urban and rural communities.

## Problem Statement

Many informal workers face significant challenges in accessing job opportunities, skill development programs, and financial resources. Key issues include:

- Difficulty finding training and upskilling opportunities relevant to their roles.

**AI Job Mentor** addresses these gaps by providing an always-available, easy-to-use mentoring platform that empowers informal workers to improve their livelihoods and progress in their careers.
